## üèóÔ∏è Folder Structure

The project follows a modular structure to ensure the code is organized, scalable, and easy to maintain.

```/stockflow-app
|
|-- /public # Static assets and index.html template
|-- /src
| |-- /components # Reusable UI components (Dashboard, Header, etc.)
| |-- /contexts # React Context for global state management
| |-- /data # Mock data for development
| |-- App.js # Root component that assembles the application
| |-- index.css # Global styles and Tailwind CSS directives
| -- index.js # Entry point of the React application |
|-- package.json # Project dependencies and scripts
|-- tailwind.config.js # Tailwind CSS theme and configuration
|-- postcss.config.js # Configuration for PostCSS (used by Tailwind)
```


## üìù Workflow Assumptions

This project was built with a clear set of assumptions to serve as a solid foundation.

1.  **Data Source (In-Memory)**: The application currently uses a local mock data array (`/src/data/mockData.js`). This was chosen for rapid prototyping. The inventory state will reset on every page refresh.

2.  **State Management (React Context)**: Global state is managed using React's Context API. This approach is ideal for avoiding "prop drilling" in small to medium-sized applications without the overhead of a larger library.

3.  **Component Architecture (Modularity)**: The UI is broken down into small, single-purpose components (`StatCard`, `InventoryList`, etc.) to promote reusability and simplify maintenance.

4.  **Styling (Utility-First)**: The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, with a custom theme defined in `tailwind.config.js`. This utility-first approach accelerates development and simplifies the creation of responsive designs.


## üöÄ Future Expansion

This application is designed for easy expansion. Here are a few ways it could be enhanced:

-   **Backend Integration**: Replace the mock data with a real API by refactoring `InventoryContext` to make asynchronous calls to a backend service (e.g., Node.js/Express) connected to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
-   **User Authentication**: Implement a login/signup system to support multiple users, with role-based access control (e.g., admin, manager, staff).
-   **Advanced Features**: Introduce features like barcode scanning, low-stock notifications, inventory history tracking, and data visualization with reporting dashboards.
-   **Robust State Management**: For more complex state interactions, migrate from Context API to a more powerful solution like **Redux Toolkit** or **Zustand**.
